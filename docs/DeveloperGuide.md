## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a contact).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* is a business owner, preferably in arts and crafts
* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast and/or prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:

CraftConnect app will keep track of the many different suppliers and
customers easily and organise them into groups. Since small business owners usually have
a lack of manpower, CraftConnect will provide an efficient solution for handling of vendor and
customer orders. On top of that, business owners can manage contacts faster than a typical
mouse/GUI driven app.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
    - CraftConnect should initialize within 2 seconds on a mid-tier computer.
    - CraftConnect should be able to hold up to 1000 contacts while keeping all operations under 100ms.
    - CraftConnect should not exceed 200MB RAM during peak operations.

2. **Usability and Accessibility**
    - All errors should be clear and actionable (e.g. if the wrong email format is used, tell the user how a correct email should look like).
    - A user with above-average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.

3. **Portability**
    - CraftConnect should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
    - Any user should be able to run CraftConnect without needing to install any other applications/dependencies (except Java 17)

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **Mid-tier computer**: A computer that is typically used for office operations and software development, but not strong enough to handle moderate gaming. For minimum-spec reference,
    * Processor (CPU): Intel Core i3 (2nd Gen)/AMD Athion 64 X2
    * Memory (RAM): 2GB RAM
    * Storage (HDD/SDD): 100MB of free disk space
    * Graphics: Integrated GPU (Intel HD Graphics 300 or equivalent)
    * Disk Speed: HDD (5400 RPM) or SSD if available.

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

    1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

    2. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

2. Saving window preferences

    1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

    2. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Deleting a contact

1. Prerequisites: List all contacts using the `list` command. Multiple contacts in the list.
2. If there is not a contact with phone number 123, add a contact with such a phone number.
    `add n/dummy e/dummy@example.com p/123 a/dummydummy`
   If there is not a contact with phone number 456, add a contact with such a phone number.
    `add n/dummy2 e/dummy2@example.com p/456 a/dummydummy2`
   If there is not a contact with email address dummy3@example.com, add a contact with such an email address.
    `add n/dummy3 e/dummy3@example.com p/789 a/dummydummy3`
   If there is not a contact with email address dummy4@example.com, add a contact with such an email address.
    `add n/dummy4 e/dummy4@example.com p/012 a/dummydummy4`

3. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
   Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

4. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
   Expected: No contact is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

5. Test case: `delete p/123`<br>
   Expected: the contact with phone number 123 is deleted. 
   Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

6. Test case: `filter a/5`, `delete p/456`
   Expected: even though the contact with phone number 456 is filtered out, deletion by phone number still succeeds.
   Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

7. Test case: `delete e/dummy3@example.com`<br>
  Expected: the contact with the email address dummy3@example.com is deleted.
  Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

8. Test case: `filter a/5`, `delete e/dummy4@example.com`
  Expected: even though the contact with email address dummy4@example.com is filtered out, deletion by email address still succeeds.
  Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

9. Other incorrect delete commands to try: 
   - `delete` 
   - `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size)
   - `delete e\NON_EXISTENT_EMAIL`
   - `delete p\NON_EXISTENT_PHONE`
   - `...`
         Expected: No contact is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
